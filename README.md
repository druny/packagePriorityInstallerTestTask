# Package installer
Didn't use any library. So You don't need to install dependencies

## Requirements
    - NodeJS > 10v

## Scripts
    - yarn start -- Run script with predefined input inside './repository/mockedPackages.json' P.S. For implementing interactive input just change implementations inside repository/package interface
    - yarn test -- 3 test cases [Succed case, Wron input case, Input with cycle dependencies]
    - yarn dev
    - yarn test:watch
